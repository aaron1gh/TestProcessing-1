1. Comments and Documentation
There are no comments in the code.

It’s hard to understand what’s happening without carefully reading each line.

Add a short explanation at the top and comments throughout to describe key steps.

2. Error Handling
The code does not check if the file path is correct or if the file exists.

If the user enters the wrong file name, the program crashes.

Suggest adding basic error messages and checks to help the user.

3. Variable Names
Most variable names are single letters like z, q, a, which are not meaningful.

This makes the code hard to read or maintain.

Use full, clear names like filePath, wordCounts, etc.

4. Code Structure
All code is inside the Main method.

It would be better to break the work into smaller parts (e.g., file reading, cleaning, counting) using methods.

5. File Handling Assumptions
The program assumes the file always exists and contains data.

It doesn’t check for empty files or handle missing ones.

Recommend checking if the file exists and providing feedback if something goes wrong.

6. Output Format
The output works, but it could be displayed in a clearer, more professional way.

For example, avoid terms like "uniquez" — use "Total unique words" instead.

7. OOP Principles
The program is written in a very basic, procedural way.

No object-oriented programming (OOP) features like classes or methods are used.

Consider creating a class to handle the text processing tasks to improve structure and reusability.
